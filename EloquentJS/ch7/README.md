7.1 (Measuring a Robot)

7.2 (Robot Efficiency): One of the best exercises in the book.
I cannot solve this one completely.

7.3 (Persistent Group): I cannot solve this completely.

"Why do you need only one PGroup.empty value, rather than having a function
that creates a new, empty map every time?"

Because PGroup.empty can give different instances of class PGroup without needing
any properties, methods or values from the class itself. Hence, having a function
is not necessary.
