# Eloquent JavaScript, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition

This directory contains all of *my* solutions to the text.

UPDATED: Due to job pressure, I decide to only spend a small amount
of time thinking on the exercises in ch19, 20, 21 (the last three chapters).
Hence, all the solutions in these chapters belong to the author even though I did spend 5-10 mins
on each of them. Chapter 22 is skipped!

## Inconsistency ~~an erratum~~ found in the book
* page 193, at *everywhere* definition, it should be
`nest.state.connections = new Map()` since you are calling an instance of a class.

The author has responded and updated both the online version and future print runs
of the book.
