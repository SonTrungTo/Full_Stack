## Build a Table
Basically finished! But I am trying to build a table where the property names are messy
(basically possible if the action was done asynchronously). Is it possible?

UPDATE: YES! Solved!

## Elements by Tag Name
Solved! Through the use of recursive function calling separately from the original one.
