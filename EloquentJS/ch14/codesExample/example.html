    <h1>My name is Son To</h1>
    <p>I am an Aalto University student turning to a programmer.</p>
    <p>I am a fan of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Theory-Andreu-Mas-Colell/dp/0195073401/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=microeconomic+theory&qid=1592044337&sr=8-1"
       target="_blank" class="Micro">Microeconomic Theory</a>.</p>

    target="_blank" id="Stat">Statistical Inference</a>.</p>

    <img src="stat.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="Casella Berger" /> has been
    for students in Statistics.</p>
