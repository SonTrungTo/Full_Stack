This section is for learning the basics of tutorials of Postgres

Postgres: join query(inner join, left outer join, right outer join,
full outer join), subquery.

**HAVING vs WHERE?**: The aggregate uses WHERE to include input rows into the function
before groups and aggregates are computed, whereas HAVING (almost every statement)
uses aggregates most of the time because it select rows after groups and aggregates
are computed.
