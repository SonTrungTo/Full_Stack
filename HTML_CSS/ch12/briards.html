    or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally
    used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
    <h3>breed history</h3>
    <p class="main">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
    centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army
    sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine
    sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point
    of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly covering. Charlemagne,
    Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
