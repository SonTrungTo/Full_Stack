    <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials
    from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important
    components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature,
    dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These
    elements vary in their compostion as well as their influence on marine life.</p>
