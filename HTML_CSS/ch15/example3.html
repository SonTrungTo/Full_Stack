      <h3>Educational Background</h3>
      <p>I first attend Aalto University in 2012 as a student
      in Economics, but I spend most of my time reading books,
      doing problems from them while most of my roommates spend
      time on partying and getting to know each other. This
      helps me master in several fields: in Microeconomics,
      I have mastered in Microeconomic Theory, Macroeconomics Theory,
      Econometrics. In Math, I have mastered Real Analysis, Measure
      Theory, Probability and Statistics. In CS, I have mastered
      Theory of Computation, Web Developing.</p>
      <p>Then in 2016, I started washing dishes at Kiltakellari,
      Sodexo Oy until 2018, when I am really fed up with the job.
      I then went to wash dishes at StaffPoint in 2018 until 2019,
      then went to wash more dishes at Nokia One, Sodexo until 2020,
      then went to mash more dishes at Arcada University, Fazer
      until the end of Feb 2020 when the Coronavirus disease started.</p>
      <p>From then on, I self-study to become a Web Developer.</p>
