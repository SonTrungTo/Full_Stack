    <h2>PC Games</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my favorite PC games. I do not play PlayStation or XBox
    ones since I am a PC master race.<br />Please <a href="mailto:son.trung.to@gmail.com">
    contact me</a> if you would like to kick my ass or disagree and want a piece
    of me.</p>
    <h3>Baldr Sky</h3>
    <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/741140/Baldr_Sky/">Baldr Sky</a>
    is a sexy-as-fuck video game with childish main character who constantly misses
    his high school periods with pretty-and-pervert-as-fuck girls.<br /> This game is
    obviously for horny teenagers who fail to have sex during his time in high school.<br />
    Very cringy game.</p>
    <h3>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order</h3>

    <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order">Jedi Fallen
    Order</a> is hell of a game. It tells story about friendship, hardship, power,
    perseverance and redemption. This is a mature game every adult must play. It's
    one hell of an experience.</p>
